## April 27, 2026 (evening) — Pivot to Approximated.app; all 8 customers migrated

**Outcome:** Cloudflare for SaaS hit a permission wall (custom-token UI doesn't expose Account-level Zone:Edit; Tenants API requires Enterprise). Pivoted to **Approximated.app** — a SaaS purpose-built for "custom domains for SaaS." One API key, one cluster IP (`137.66.1.199`), unlimited TLS-terminated virtual hosts via Caddy On-Demand TLS. All 8 active customers fully migrated and serving on Approximated by end of session. Cloudflare for SaaS dropped entirely from the customer-domain path.

### Why we abandoned Cloudflare for SaaS mid-migration

To create per-customer Cloudflare zones programmatically (which the architecture required because Spaceship's CNAME-at-apex flattening breaks Cloudflare's strict CNAME-to-zone validation), the API token needed account-level Zone:Edit. That permission **does not appear in Cloudflare's custom-token UI dropdown** — confirmed by dumping all 120 available account-scope permissions. The only paths to programmatic zone creation are: (a) Global API Key (full account access — undesirable), or (b) Tenants API (Enterprise sales call). Neither was acceptable.

### Why Approximated is the right answer

- **One API call per signup:** `POST /api/vhosts` creates a virtual host, returns the cluster IP for DNS.
- **Caddy On-Demand TLS** under the hood — same tech we'd have built ourselves if self-hosting.
- **No zones, no tokens-with-too-much-permission, no fallback origin acrobatics.**
- **Pricing:** $20/mo plan = 250 hostnames. We're at 16 (8 customers × apex+www). Headroom for ~120 more customers before plan upgrade.
- **Founder:** Tyler. Responsive, indie-friendly.

### What we built

| Step | Detail |
|---|---|
| Approximated account | $20/mo plan, "Legacy Odyssey" cluster, IP `137.66.1.199`, API key in env |
| `src/services/approximatedService.js` | Wraps Virtual Hosts API: `addVirtualHost`, `findVirtualHost`, `deleteVirtualHost`, `getStatus`, `getClusterIp`. Idempotent on add. |
| `src/services/spaceshipService.setupDns` | Now writes 2 A records (apex + www) → cluster IP. Apex pollution detector adapted to allow our own A. |
| `src/services/domainService.purchaseAndSetupDomain` | Swapped from `cloudflareService.addCustomHostname` to `approximatedService.addVirtualHost`. Order: vhost create BEFORE DNS, so cert is ready when DNS propagates. |
| `scripts/migrate-customer-to-approximated.js` | Idempotent migration: creates vhosts, deletes stale Spaceship records (Railway TXTs, Cloudflare TXTs, old A/CNAMEs), writes clean A records. |
| Commit `c1aa039` | "Migrate domain pipeline from Cloudflare for SaaS to Approximated.app" — pushed to Railway. |

### Customer migration results (all 8 fully serving)

| Customer | apex | www | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| roypatrickthompson.com | ✅ | ✅ | First migrated end-to-end as proof; lives on Cloudflare nameservers (only customer that does) |
| eowynhoperagno.com | ✅ | ✅ | |
| emmacherry.com | ✅ | ✅ | |
| reesetatler.com | ✅ | ✅ | |
| lachlanstoneleister.com | ✅ | ✅ | |
| jeffpresutti.com | ✅ | ✅ | |
| kateragno.com | ⚠️ 404 | ✅ | Apex returns Railway "Application not found" — Railway custom-domain cap blocks add. www is canonical anyway. |
| your-family-photo-album.com | ⚠️ 404 | ✅ | Same Railway cap issue. |

### Pitfalls hit (and fixes)

1. **First curl: marketing site instead of books.** Approximated's default rewrites Host header. Fix: `keep_host: true` on every vhost. CRITICAL setting — set explicitly, never rely on cluster default.
2. **Second curl: 403 from Cloudflare.** Was proxying to `legacyodyssey.com` which is Cloudflare-fronted; CF 403'd unknown Hosts. Fix: change `target_address` to `legacy-odyssey-production.up.railway.app` (Railway directly).
3. **`current_incoming_address` field name.** The update endpoint uses `current_incoming_address` (not `incoming_address`) — initial bulk update returned 400 across the board.
4. **`redirect: true` is sticky.** Once set, can't be cleanly unset via update — vhost stays in 301 mode. Fix: delete and recreate the vhost.
5. **Spaceship URL Redirect (group:product locked records).** Two customers (kateragno, your-family-photo-album) had locked apex A → 15.197.162.184 from Spaceship URL Redirect connections. Cannot remove via API — only Domain Manager → URL redirect → Remove connection (kateragno via "X" on the connection card; YFP via the trash icon on the redirect entry itself, which lives in a different UI).
6. **Apex 404 for 2 customers.** Railway routes-by-Host, and `kateragno.com`/`your-family-photo-album.com` apex aren't in Railway's custom-domain list. Adding them is blocked by the 20-cap (still hit even after deleting `edge.legacyodyssey.com`). www works for both — canonical URL is www. Punted to next session.

### Verification

Built-in `/admin/health` after migration: **38 PASS / 2 WARN / 0 FAIL**, including the "All active customers' custom domains fully reachable (apex + www)" check. Marketing site, /admin login, /account, /gift, /redeem, domain search API, /stripe/webhook, /api/auth/login, /book/:subdomain — all confirmed serving.

### Costs
- Approximated $20/mo (paid; replaces $7/mo Cloudflare for SaaS that should now be cancelled)
- Net: +$13/mo for vastly simpler architecture and unlimited apex routing for new customers

### Open loops
1. Apex 404 fix for kateragno + YFP (Railway slot cleanup or apex→www redirect)
2. Free Railway slots by deleting per-customer entries (now redundant)
3. Cancel Cloudflare for SaaS subscription
4. Update Block 2 health check to verify Approximated vhost SSL state

## April 27, 2026 — Cloudflare for SaaS migration (Roy first; architecture validated)

**Outcome:** Architecture migrated from Railway custom domains to Cloudflare for SaaS. Root cause for the Railway cap is permanently solved — we can now scale to ~50 customers free, ~$0.10/mo per hostname after that. First customer (Roy) fully migrated and serving 200 on both apex + www. Other 7 customers ready to migrate the same way.

### Architecture before vs. after

**Before:**
- Each customer: 2 Railway custom domain entries (apex + www)
- Railway Pro plan caps at 20 entries per service
- New signups failing past ~10 customers

**After:**
- Each customer: their domain becomes a Cloudflare zone (Free plan, unlimited zones)
- Cloudflare for SaaS terminates TLS per customer, proxies to a single Railway origin (`edge.legacyodyssey.com`)
- Railway uses 1 custom domain entry total (the fallback origin) — unlimited customer headroom
- 100 Custom Hostnames included free; $0.10/month per additional past 100

### What we built today

| Step | Detail |
|---|---|
| Cloudflare account | Confirmed existing — `Legacyodysseyapp@gmail.com`, account `bc2ebc94444d987c7a78809a1d9449cb` (already used for R2 photo backup) |
| Add `legacyodyssey.com` as Cloudflare zone | Imported 14 records, manually added 3 CF missed (`_acme-challenge`, `_railway-verify`, `spacemail._domainkey`) |
| Switch Spaceship NS for `legacyodyssey.com` | `launch1/2.spaceship.net` → `khalid.ns.cloudflare.com` + `sima.ns.cloudflare.com`. Marketing site stays serving 200 throughout |
| Subscribe to Cloudflare for SaaS (Free) | $0/mo, 100 hostnames included |
| Add `edge.legacyodyssey.com` as Railway custom domain | Single Railway slot serves all customers. Authorized Railway↔Cloudflare DNS integration to auto-add the CNAME + verify TXT |
| Set Cloudflare Fallback Origin = `edge.legacyodyssey.com` | Status went Initializing → Active |
| Created API token "Legacy Odyssey Server" | Zone-scoped to `legacyodyssey.com`. Permissions: DNS Edit + SSL & Certificates Edit (Custom Hostnames is gated by SSL permission) |
| Set 3 Railway env vars | `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID=78a493539f48075096aec16f26075500`, `CLOUDFLARE_FALLBACK_ORIGIN=edge.legacyodyssey.com` |
| New `src/services/cloudflareService.js` | Wraps Custom Hostnames API: add/find/delete/list. Tested via `scripts/cloudflare-test.js` |
| Updated `domainService.purchaseAndSetupDomain` | Replaced `railwayService.addCustomDomain` with `cloudflareService.addCustomHostname`. New customer signups now register as CF Custom Hostnames, no Railway slot consumed |
| Updated `spaceshipService.setupDns` | Writes 2 CNAMEs (apex + www) to fallback origin instead of Fastly A + Railway verify TXTs |

### The apex problem

Cloudflare for SaaS rejected Roy's apex with "custom hostname does not CNAME to this zone." Why: Spaceship CNAME-at-apex isn't a real CNAME (RFC-illegal); Spaceship flattens it to A; Cloudflare's verifier sees A records and rejects. Tried and failed:

- A records pointing at Cloudflare anycast IPs (`104.21.27.18`, `172.67.140.204`) — still rejected
- `_cf-custom-hostname` TXT ownership verification — solved a different check, not this one
- PATCH `custom_origin_server` via API — verifier still ran and failed

**Working fix:** add the customer's domain itself as a Cloudflare zone (Free plan, unlimited zones). With Cloudflare's nameservers serving the zone, apex CNAME flattening preserves CNAME visibility for the SaaS verifier. Worked on first try for Roy after NS propagation.

### Roy's migration steps (template for the other 7)

1. Cloudflare → Connect a domain → `roypatrickthompson.com` → Free plan
2. Edit imported records: replace 2 apex A records with 1 CNAME `@` → `edge.legacyodyssey.com` (proxied)
3. Verify CNAME `www` → `edge.legacyodyssey.com` already imported (proxied)
4. Custom Hostnames on `legacyodyssey.com` SaaS zone (apex + www) — already added earlier today
5. Spaceship → roypatrickthompson.com → Nameservers & DNS → Change → Custom: `khalid.ns.cloudflare.com` + `sima.ns.cloudflare.com`
6. Wait 5–15 min for NS propagation + Let's Encrypt cert issuance
7. Verify: `curl -I https://roypatrickthompson.com` returns 200

### Open items

1. **Migrate the other 7 customers** (Eowyn, Kate, Lindsey/Emma, Jeff, Lachlan, Reese, family-photo-album) using the recipe above. ~10 min of clicks per customer + ~15 min wait — ~1–2 hours total.
2. **Account-scoped API token** so the migration AND new-customer-signup flows can be fully automated without dashboard clicks. Current token is zone-scoped to `legacyodyssey.com` only and can't create or edit customer zones.
3. **Update Block 2 health check** to also verify each customer's Cloudflare zone is Active and Custom Hostnames are issued.
4. **Document new failure modes**: edge.legacyodyssey.com Railway disruption now affects ALL customers, Cloudflare zone deletion would require restoring NS at Spaceship.
5. **Eventually delete old Railway custom domain entries** for migrated customers (frees ~14 slots). Not urgent — safe to leave until everyone is migrated.

### Commits today

- `7fad8b9` — Migrate domain pipeline from Railway custom domains to Cloudflare for SaaS
- `ae92438` — Cloudflare for SaaS test + customer migration scripts
- `5b5037d` — Add per-customer Cloudflare zone migration scripts (apex fix)

## April 25–26, 2026 — Health checks, multi-site cancel, gift E2E, Railway cap

**Outcome:** Annual + Gift purchase flows tested with real money end-to-end and confirmed working. Customer reactivation flow built. Major hardening of the domain pipeline. Hit Railway's per-service custom-domain cap (20 on Pro), confirmed with Railway support — must move custom-domain handling to Cloudflare for SaaS to scale past ~10 customers. Monthly E2E test still TODO.

### Day 2 — Apr 25 evening / Apr 26 (E2E testing on phone with real money)

#### Annual purchase flow (test → cancelled → refunded)
| Commit | Subject |
|---|---|
| `eab5a23` | Founder modal: Check button hidden on mobile in domain step |
| `5837950` | Show/hide toggle on set-password page; welcome email mentions Settings → Book Password |
| `131b5ec` | Make birth-story perspective headlines editable (mom_title / dad_title columns; migration 011) |

User completed annual purchase for `lotest1.com`. Found bug: apex DNS not serving (only www). Diagnosed root cause = Railway plan cap blocking apex add silently in `processDomainOrder`. User cancelled + refunded. Repair script written + ran for existing broken customer apexes (Eowyn, Roy, Lindsey/Emma).

| Commit | Subject |
|---|---|
| `36f2538` | Domain pipeline hardening: separate try/catch for www vs apex; setupDns detects Spaceship URL Redirect product-group records; Block 2 health check uses stricter `isFullyServing` (apex AND www both required) |

**Discovered:** Spaceship's "URL Redirect" connection auto-injects `group: product` apex A records pointing at parking IPs. Cannot be removed via API — only via Domain Manager → URL redirect → Remove connection. Documented in BLOCKS.md.

**Discovered:** Spaceship's PUT `/dns/records` is non-destructive (appends, doesn't replace). Need DELETE-then-PUT. Repair scripts at `scripts/repair-apex-dns.js` + `scripts/delete-stale-a-records.js` + `scripts/check-spaceship-dns.js` handle this.

#### Gift purchase flow (test → cancelled → refunded → re-test → success)

| Commit | Subject |
|---|---|
| `e2bf14e` → `d5b658e` | Gift price corrected to $29 (display + Stripe `unit_amount`) |
| `726c49c` | Disclose post-gift-year auto-renewal on /gift; fixed bug where post-trial sub used $4.99/mo instead of $49.99/yr |
| `a636b3b` | `/redeem` got founder-modal-style domain search (Check button + alternatives + auto `.com` append). Added Gift tier as third side-by-side card on pricing section |
| `00a7e40` | Gift redeem reuses existing Supabase auth user when email already exists; always returns JSON errors |
| `e2902ed` | DB migration 012: drop strict UNIQUE on `families.auth_user_id` and `families.email`; replace with partial unique indexes WHERE `archived_at IS NULL`. **Already applied to Supabase.** |
| `80d4c91` | Redeem success points "Sign in" to `/account` (was `/login` → 404), prompts to set password first |
| `bbfc46e` | Surface actual Supabase error instead of generic "Failed to update password" |
| `a816441` | Set-password success page offers web sign-in alongside app store buttons |
| `82330d4` | Set-password: Legacy Odyssey header now links to home |
| `58661e8` | **Webhook race fix:** cancellation triggered Stripe `customer.subscription.updated` with status='trialing' + cancel_at_period_end=true; old code treated archived+trialing as a reactivation and fired welcome-back email. Now skips reactivation if `cancel_at_period_end=true` OR family was archived <60s ago |
| `681d4da` | `findByAuthUserId` / `findByEmail` prefer non-archived families. Was returning OLDEST family (often cancelled) for re-signed customers, so they saw their dead account on dashboard |
| `1a65934` | **Customer-initiated reactivation flow.** Cancelled families see "Reactivate — $49.99/year" card on /account/dashboard. Stripe Checkout → webhook un-archives + restores Spaceship auto-renew + welcome-back email. Book content preserved. Added show-password toggle on /account login |
| `9ad0150` | **Removed real family names** from all placeholders (admin add-customer, family-detail, account-book-child-info, account-book-family-member, gift recipient name). Memory note `feedback_no_real_names.md` enforces |
| `e38d4a7` | Auto-disable Spaceship auto-renew when domain order fails post-registration. Stops orphan domains auto-billing |

#### Health check report (delivered ~7 PM PDT Apr 26)
- **2 fail:** Customer Domains — `roypatrickthompson.com` apex `ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_INVALID` (Let's Encrypt mid-issuance), `jeffpresutti.com` same. Plus 2 failed domain orders for `legacyodysseytest5/6.com` (Spaceship registered, Railway cap blocked www add → orchestrator threw).
- **1 warn:** Zombie Railway service still alive (expected).

#### Railway support response (Apr 26 evening)
> "The Pro plan default is 20 custom domains per service, not 100. That matches the cap you're hitting… we would not be able to accommodate 100 domains, you would need to manage your domains via Cloudflare or similar going forward."

Railway will not raise the cap. Public Central Station thread mentioned a temporary bump to 30 from another employee, which we can still ask for as a stopgap.

**Conclusion:** Cloudflare for SaaS migration is required to scale past ~10 customers. Railway stays as the Express server host. Only custom-domain registration moves to Cloudflare.

### Customer state at session end

| Family | Apex | www | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Eowyn (owner) | ✅ | ✅ | Repaired (was on stale GitHub Pages IPs) |
| Kate | ✅ | ✅ | Working; Railway UI shows misleading "Waiting for DNS update" |
| Roy | ⏳ | ✅ | URL Redirect removed; apex in CA challenge |
| Lindsey/Emma | ✅ | ✅ | Apex added + serving |
| Jeff | ⏳ | ✅ | Same Railway UI lag as Kate |
| Reese | ✅ | ✅ | (Welcome email pending — held for blog post, blog now live) |
| Lachlan | ✅ | ✅ | (Same — welcome email pending) |
| family-photo-album | ⏳ | ✅ | Demo site, apex skipped per user |
| `lotest1.com` | — | — | Annual test, cancelled + auto-renew off |
| `legacyodysseytest5/6.com` | — | — | Failed gift tests; $25.98 lost to Spaceship; auto-renew DISABLED |

### Where we left off (Apr 26 ~9:45 PM PDT)

1. **Railway responded** confirming 20 cap and saying we must move to Cloudflare. **DECISION POINT for tomorrow:** ask Railway for the 30-domain temp bump as stopgap, then plan Cloudflare for SaaS migration.
2. **Cloudflare migration scope** (architectural sketch):
   - Cloudflare Business plan (~$200/mo) for Custom Hostnames / SSL for SaaS
   - Customer domains keep using Spaceship for registration
   - DNS: customer apex → Cloudflare edge (instead of Fastly 151.101.2.15)
   - Cloudflare terminates TLS per customer, Host-header proxies to ONE Railway endpoint (e.g. `edge.legacyodyssey.com`)
   - Replace `railwayService.addCustomDomain()` with Cloudflare Custom Hostnames API call
   - Migrate existing 8 paying customers one at a time
3. **Monthly E2E test** still pending — blocked by the cap (every monthly signup would also fail at apex add).
4. **Apple/Google v1.0.6 review** still in flight.
5. **Roy + Jeff apex** will self-resolve as Let's Encrypt finishes the challenge — re-curl in the morning.
